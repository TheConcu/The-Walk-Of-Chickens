# The-Walk-Of-Chickens
A non-fiction game made with Bitsy.

With the thought of food on the mind. I came across an article to make a dish with chicken. But then an idea came when I didn't know the process of how the chicken comes from the farm, they are born on to the stores we buy the meat. Which then became the idea of a chicken's journey. 

Using the game engine site, Bitsy, I made a top-down experience of the journey with researching sources to guide the narrative. The perspective you are playing through is the chicken going through the process of which it takes from birth all the way to a dish at someone's house for the dish that they are making.
